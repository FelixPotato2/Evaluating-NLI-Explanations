Files for our project are: 

processing_EA.py
    Functions to remove irrelevant info from the esnli dataset and to select problems relevent for our project from the dataset. 
Explore_esnli_data.py 
    I use this script to get some insight into the way a dataset looks by printing the first 10 rows in a somwhat readable way. 

Extract_correct_ansers.py
    contains functions to create from a dataset a prompt for an LLM as well as the correct answers. 
    Contains function to evaluate LLM answer based on the answer we expect. (needs work)
    

all other files I imported from the previous project as inspiration and you can ignore.
