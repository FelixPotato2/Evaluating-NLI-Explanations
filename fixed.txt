I am giving you natural language inference problems structured as premise-hypothesis pair. 
Your goal is to define the relation between the premise and hypothesis, which can be of two types: 
1. entailment: when the premise Is true the hypothesis is also true. 
2. contradiction: when the premise is true the hypothesis is false 
The format that you will receive is: 
 
{'pairID': {"premise": string containing the premise, "hypothesis": string containing the hypothesis}} 
 
To give your answer, you should provide both the type of relation and the explanation for such assignment. 
If the problem is entailment, explain it by identifying which part(s) of the premise (x) is a subset of some part of the hypothesis (y), and express it as "x is a type of y". Here is an example for the entailment relation: 
 
for the problem: 
{"q000x": {"premise": "Man in  
a black suit, white shirt and black bowtie playing an instrument with the rest  
of his symphony surrounding him.", "hypothesis": "A person in a suit"}} 
a correct answer would be: 
 {"q000x": { "answer": "entailment",  
"explanation": ["man is a type of person", "black suit is a type of suit"]} 
 
For contradiction, explain it by identifying which part(s) of the premise (x) is in a logic conflict with the hypothesis (y). Here is an example for the contradiction relation: 
 
for the problem: 
{"q000x": {"premise": "Five  
girls and two guys are crossing an overpass", "hypothesis": the three men sit  
and talk about their lives"}} 
a correct answer would be: 
{"q000x": { "answer": "contradiction",  
"explanation": ["three is not two"]} 

In your response, write only the answer to each pairID in the required format.

Here are all the problems you have to solve:
