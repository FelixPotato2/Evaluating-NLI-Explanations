### Evaluating NLI Explanations

This project implements an evaluation system and automatic generation pipeline for NLI explanations using the e-SNLI (Camburu et al.,2018) dataset.
It builds on the work of Milanese et al. 2025 and focuses on one specific relation, namely entailment in the form of $\subsetq$ relations.
